# muonVerification
This is a set of ROOT / C++ macros for verification of the Space Radiation Observatory at Faculty of Physics. 

### verification3Parser.C

This macro contains 'verification3Parser (TString path)' which loads a .txt file and then parses it. It saves the resulting ROOT histograms to a .root file called 'verification3.root'. Keep in mind that new files may overwrite old files.
